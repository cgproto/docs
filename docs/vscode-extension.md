# VSCode Extension

From version over 2.4, you are able to coding on you desktop and synchronize files to CGProto by using our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cgproto.cgproto-vscode).


Perform the following steps to start coding on your desktop.
- check that the mobile device and your desktop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cgproto.cgproto-vscode) from the extension marketplace
- turn on the remote coding switch on the settings menu in CGProto.

- all source files in the project would be downloaded to the folder that you pick
- by default, when you save a file on VSCode, it is synchronized to CGProto, and the corresponding node is updated if the project is opened in the editor. 
- you could alternatively turn off the autoPush option in the VSCode extension settings and push the whole project to CGProto manually.

Here is how you find your mobile device's IP address
- Go into Settings
- Click on Wi-Fi
- Scroll down to the lowercase i, which stands for Information, next to the Wi-Fi network youâ€™re connected to currently.
- Scroll down to IPv4 Address. The IP address will be there.

We also make a video to demonstrate this new feature. You could watch it on [youtube](https://youtu.be/ol0FXjQ5th8) or
